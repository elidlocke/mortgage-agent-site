Installing new hardwood flooring in your home can be quite costly. However, if you've already got it, why not flaunt it? 

## The Lucky Ones
Check under your carpet. Many homeowners have no idea that they already have beautiful hardwood floors. Most of the brick houses built in the Waterloo Region before the 1950's had hardwood floors installed. In the 70's and 80's, it because popular to cover up those floors with carpet. We often help homeowners remove carpet to reveal hardwood. Lucky for them, refinishing an existing hardwood floor is much cheaper than installing a new one.

## The Fixer Upper Floors
Our bread and butter is floors that are already exposed, but need some love. Years of use on hardwood floors wears through the top layer of finish. To determine if these floors are a good candidate for refinishing, we have to check the remaining depth of the floorboards. This can easily be done by lifting out a floor vent and looking at the cross-section of the floorboards. If there is enough wood left on top of the tongue and groove, then we can safely refinish your floors.

## The Engineered Floors
Engineered floors get two lives, meaning they can be sanded only once after installation. If you have engineered floors that have been installed in the past 5-10 years and never sanded, chances are we can take a tiny layer off the floor to restore their look. Working with engineered flooring is the most dangerous because if it's not thick enough, the sanding machines may wear through the floor and cause damage.

## Still not sure?
If all else fails and you can't figure out whether or not you have hardwood floors, give us a call.
